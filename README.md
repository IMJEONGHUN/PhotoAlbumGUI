Testing done in Eclipse.

Notes:
1)
"photoname" field of photos are the absolute paths after initial adding. They should be entered as such for all functions in console

2)
"Recaption" function works as follows

reacaption "filepath" "<newcaption>"

Success:
Photo <filepath>  recaptioned to: <newcaption>
Failure:
"Error recaptioning photo."
